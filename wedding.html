		<h1>Best Wedding!<h1/>

		<P> Last weekend I went home for Columbus day weekend to attend my cousins wedding. It was the best wedding I have ever been in and the most beautiful wedding I have ever seen.
			<P> My cousin looked amazing and her new husband looked like a stud. They will make a great couple and I am so happy for them.
				<P> Everyone had a great time at the wedding and I hope they have a fantastic honeymoon.</P>
