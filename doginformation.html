	<h2>The Havanese Breed<h2/>

	<P> Havanese Dogs are Cuba's national dog breed. They are small and adorable. They are easy to train and easy to take care of. They do not like to be alone so you need to give them plenty of attention.<P/>
	<P> Havanese Dogs are very loyal and are easy to fall in love with. They are very fun and friendly dogs but my dog is affarid of other dogs which can be annoying whenever we go on walks in a park. They are also very intellegent dogs so you shouldn't have to worry about them doing stupid things. <P/>
	<P> My dog loves his treats so if you get a Havanese make sure they have plenty of bones and cookies! My dog also loves belly rubs so be prepared to give plenty of belly rubs. </P>
	<P> Havanese are know to be either good apartment dogs or house dogs and they are great with kids. </P>
	<P> I highly recommend these dogs they are great companions!</P>
