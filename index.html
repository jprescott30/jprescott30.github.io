<h1>Welcome! My name is Jake Prescott </h1>
I am a huge sports fan. I am a die hard Patriots and Celtics fan. I am also a fan of the Red Soxs and Bruins but I do not watch every game like I do the Patriots and Celtics.

<P>Welcome to my page I have a dog named Teddy and he is a Havanese breed and they come from Cuba. Im from <b>Haverhill MA</b> and it is so different than Maine in many ways but so far I love living and being at school here.</P>

<P> I play intramural flag football at Umaine. My team is very bad we only have 2 people on the team who played football in high school (myself included). It is still a lot of fun to play and mess around.</P>
