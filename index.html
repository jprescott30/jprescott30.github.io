<h1>Jake Prescott </h1>
I am a huge sports fan.

<P>Welcome to my page I have a dog named Teddy and he is a Havanese breed and they come from Cuba. Im from <b>Haverhill MA</b> and it is so different than Maine.</P>

<P> I play intramural flag football at Umaine. My team is kinda trash we only have 2 people on the team who played football in high school (myself included). It is still a lot of fun to play and mess around.</P>
